HX711 TO ATMEGA128
This project was developed using AtmelStudio7 (version 7.0.129) IDE.

Basic Functionality
The primary function is as follows:
This code reads values from an HX711 (1KG) sensor using the ATMEGA128 microcontroller and transmits the data via USART1 (BLE/HC-06 at 9600 BPS) and USART0 (at 115200 BPS).

Although not thoroughly organized, this project may serve as a useful reference.
